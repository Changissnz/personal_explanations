I will not be the one that needs to explain myself away, like how the damned are forced into orchestras.

social structure that I but play a mere secondary role in. 

The powers that be, the ones that are in charge, exercise their force and their book of law more than explain

things that is the ultimate factor in placing them on the spectrum of morality. 

Freemen talk so that the night does not set in, allowing the sickness to cut through to the bone.
